For the gpt script: got the api calls working from command prompt with program.cs in the test folder, but ran into issues with integrating it with unity (chatgpthandler.cs file). Found this implementation online but couldn't get it to work, might just need some new eyes on it since I've been trying to learn unity and get this to work for a while today. The website has a step by step with code included along with a youtube video walkthrough if needed: https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/how-to-use-chatgpt-in-unity
